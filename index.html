                                <li>This visualization contains areas since each state is represented with a 2D height and width.</li>
                                <li>This was a good choice because it is accurate, discernable, separable, and groups well. Specifically, the reader can easily understand that this is a political map (accurate). The levels of channels are easily discernable as the reader can differentiate between color and position. We can also see that channels exist integrally with each other and distant groups are easily inferable.

                                <li>This was a good choice because it is easily discernable from the rest of the map and does not confuse the reader. The colors are consistent to allow for easy grouping.

                                <li>This was not a geat choice because it does not allow for strong accuracy. Although reading the numbers, a reader can understand votes needed to win, the color of the slider tells the opposite story. The color indicates that the democratic party is winning.</li>

                                <li>Blue and red are used to represent the democratic and republican parties, respectively. In addition, a combination of blue and red are used to indicate that Nebraska had a combination of blue and red voters.</li>
                                <li>This is a good choice the colors follow the existing colors of the two parties. Most readers would not have to read the title of the map to recognize that this refers to U.S. politics. It has a high degree of effectiveness and has visual-popout.</li>

                                <li>This is a good choice because it only uses colors previously associated with the political parties and does not confuse the reader. It saves space on the encoding as well because there is no need for a legend.</li>

                                <li>This is good mapping since plotting every single batted ball allows the user to get a better sense of how many balls were hit at the different launch angles and exit velocities; creating a easily readable scatter.</li>

                                <li>This is a good mapping because each color category is easily discernable from the other. Although nuances between the saturation of each hue is more difficult to see, the differences between "Below", "Avg." and "Above Avg." is distinguishable.</li>
